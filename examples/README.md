# Examples Directory

This directory will be a collection of sub-directories that show off the ability to generate PDF's using Markdown and Pandoc. Each sub-directory will have a README.md file explaining that example, a `SOURCE.md` file that will be used aas a source to generate a PDF, and `compile.sh`, a shell script that will invoke the proper `pandoc` commands to create such a file.

# Example 0
Markdown --> HTML. Let's start with the basics to ensure `pandoc` is working correctly, and understand how Markdown *should* look.

# Example 1
Markdown --> PDF. Let's kick things up a notch, and create some professional looking documentation utilizing only the built-in features of Markdown.

# Example 2
Markdown + LaTeX --> PDF. 

# Example 3
Markdown + LaTeX --> PDF, including a customized LaTeX header.

# Bonus
If I have time, I might show off using custom CSS when generating HTML documents from Markdown documents.
